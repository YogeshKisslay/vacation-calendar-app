# Vacation Calendar - Full-Stack MERN Project

üìñ About The Project

  This is a complete full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that serves as a dynamic and feature-rich Vacation Calendar. The application fetches real-time public holiday data for countries around the world and presents it in a beautiful, intuitive, and highly interactive user interface.
